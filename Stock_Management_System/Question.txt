A company buys products from its vendors and sells it to its customers.

The company will buy the products by paying the vendor and then the vendor ships the products. 
Then the company will receive the products and stores in its stock. Similarly, 
the company will sell the products by receiving payment from its customers and then 
deliver the products from its stock.

Develop a stock management system for the company. It will have a list of products 
and both Incoming and Outgoing goods tracked through Purchase Bilis(PB) and Sales Billis(SB)

PB will have the status of Paid and Received. When the status is moved to Received from Paid, 
stock should be increased

SB will have the status of Paid and Delivered. When the status is moved to Delivered from Paid, 
stock should be decreased.

An SB/PB will have multiple products in it

The developed system should be able to generate the below metrics:

Current stock availability of a product

Stock value of a product

Quantity to be received

Quantity needed to deliver the paid SB

Overall stock value of that organization (stock value of all products)

Quantity received for a product during a date range

Quantity delivered for a product during a date range
